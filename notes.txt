    - Starting over, once again, from scratch. this time deployment comes first, until i reach some arbitrary stage of stability.
    - the goal here is, again: deployment first.
    - Road map (Add notes below, keep this clean):
        - [X] hello world
        - [X] postgres in production
        - [X] postgres in development
        - [X] development/production settings
        - [X] templates
        - [X] Sentry
        - [ ] version control (should've been first, whoops)
        - [ ] static files
        - [ ] logging
        (App features)
        - [ ] Image uploader
        - [ ] Users/accounts app
        - [ ] Auctions site
        - [ ] Comments
        - [ ] Stripe payment
        - [ ] Email integration

    - Dev/prod settings:
        - see if django-environ works on both environments. definitely easiest to use .env file locally, so that'd be preferred
        if it also works on the server.
            - Yes! i guess the server also includes env variables in a .env file so it's able to read it. convenient.
